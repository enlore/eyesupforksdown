And why do I think etiquette is so important?</h2></div></div></div></header><section class="about-copy"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2"><p>I have been a resident of the Clarksville and Hopkinsville area(s)
since 1988.  As a military spouse, I travelled extensively, and
had the privilege of meeting, working and socializing with people
from all over the globe.  Observing different cultures and
traditions proved both educational and exciting.
</p><p><em>What consistently held my interest was how people interacted
with each other</em>.  Why did they behave differently from me?
What traditions were important to them?  In my search for
understanding, one common element was predominant – there were
rules of behavior to be taught, followed and practiced.  Simply
put, there was “etiquette”!
</p><p>When followed by the majority of the community these rules
created harmony.  Day to day pursuits went smoother.  Mutual
respect always prevailed.  I was eager to know more and equally
enthusiastic to share this information with others.  My search
led me to the Etiquette and Leadership Institute, the nation’s
leader in training and certifying consultants to teach children,
teens, collegians and adults. © The training I received prepared
me to educate others in etiquette, manners and leadership in an
encouraging way. It also brought home the fact that possessing
good manners socially and professionally are still as relevant
today as they ever were in the past.  It is my mission to teach
these important skills in a format easy for any age to grasp and
implement.  I provide the necessary insight, and you become your
own success story.
</p><p>Remember… It is better to know good manners whenever you need
them, rather than to need good manners and not know them.  What’s
in name?  Eyes Up, Forks Down… Eyes Up – You are engaged in your
surroundings.  You are making eye contact.  You are listening to
the other person.  You are looking in the direction you are
heading - forward.

</p><p>Forks Down – You put your personal priorities aside to show
interest in the other - person.  You stop eating and make
conversation.  You are there for the company not just the meal.</p></div></div></div></section><footer id="contact-me"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 text-center"><h1>Give me a call</h1><h2><a href="tel:+19319994444">931 999 4444</a></h2><h1>Or send me an email</h1><h2><a href="mailto:patwoods12@yahoo.com">pat@eyesupforksdown.com</a></h2><div class="byline"><p>&copy;2014 Eyes Up, Forks Down</p><p>Conceived and concocted by &nbsp;<a href="//elcreativegroup.com" target="_blank">Elliott &amp; Lorenson</a></p></div><p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p></div></div><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2"><img src="/images/filigree-horizontal-upsidedown.png" class="img-responsive center-block"></div></div></div></div></footer><script src="javascripts/vendor.js"></script><script src="javascripts/app.js"></script><script>require('initialize');</script></body></html>
