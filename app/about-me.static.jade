          p.
            I have been a resident of the Clarksville and Hopkinsville area(s)
            since 1988.  As a military spouse, I travelled extensively, and
            had the privilege of meeting, working and socializing with people
            from all over the globe.  Observing different cultures and
            traditions proved both educational and exciting.  

          p.
            <em>What consistently held my interest was how people interacted
            with each other</em>.  Why did they behave differently from me?
            What traditions were important to them?  In my search for
            understanding, one common element was predominant – there were
            rules of behavior to be taught, followed and practiced.  Simply
            put, there was “etiquette”!

          p.
            When followed by the majority of the community these rules
            created harmony.  Day to day pursuits went smoother.  Mutual
            respect always prevailed.  I was eager to know more and equally
            enthusiastic to share this information with others.  My search
            led me to the Etiquette and Leadership Institute, the nation’s
            leader in training and certifying consultants to teach children,
            teens, collegians and adults. © The training I received prepared
            me to educate others in etiquette, manners and leadership in an
            encouraging way. It also brought home the fact that possessing
            good manners socially and professionally are still as relevant
            today as they ever were in the past.  It is my mission to teach
            these important skills in a format easy for any age to grasp and
            implement.  I provide the necessary insight, and you become your
            own success story.

            Remember… It is better to know good manners whenever you need
            them, rather than to need good manners and not know them.  What’s
            in name?  Eyes Up, Forks Down… Eyes Up – You are engaged in your
            surroundings.  You are making eye contact.  You are listening to
            the other person.  You are looking in the direction you are
            heading - forward.


          p.
            Forks Down – You put your personal priorities aside to show
            interest in the other - person.  You stop eating and make
            conversation.  You are there for the company not just the meal.
